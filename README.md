# gpg-mailgate

gpg-mailgate is a content filter for Postfix that automatically encrypts unencrypted incoming email using PGP or S/MIME for select recipients. It is also able to decrypt incoming PGP mails.

For installation instructions, please refer to the included INSTALL file.

# Features
- Correctly displays attachments and general email content; currently will only display first part of multipart messages
- Public keys are stored in a dedicated gpg-home-directory
- Encrypts both matching incoming and outgoing mail (this means gpg-mailgate can be used to encrypt outgoing mail for software that doesn't support PGP or S/MIME)
- Decrypts PGP encrypted mails for present private keys (but no signature check and it does not always work with PGP/INLINE encrypted mails)
- Easy installation
- gpg-mailgate-web extension is a web interface allowing any user to upload PGP keys so that emails sent to them from your mail server will be encrypted (see gpg-mailgate-web directory for details)
- people can submit their public key like to any keyserver to gpg-mailgate with the gpg-mailgate-web extension
- people can send an S/MIME signed email to register@yourdomain.tld to register their public key
- people can send their public OpenPGP key as attachment or inline to register@yourdomain.tld to register it
